# Room Design Challenge

Thank you for your interest in joining our team!

This coding exercise is designed to assess your full-stack engineering skills, systems thinking, and your ability to build robust, scalable web applications. The core stack for this project includes a React frontend and a Java Spring Boot backend.

Please begin by forking this repository. Do not make changes directly to the original repository. All work should be done in your own fork.

## Getting Started

### Backend

1. Build & run via Docker:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

The API will be available at: [http://localhost:8080/api](http://localhost:8080/api)

### Frontend

1. In a separate terminal, navigate to the `frontend/` folder.
2. Install dependencies and start the app:

## Candidate Tasks to Complete

1. **Implement Backend Logic**  
   Complete the `RoomService` to return furniture items that fit within a given room. Given a room and its dimensions, the service should calculate which furniture objects can fit inside, accounting for the space already occupied by any selected items (e.g. sofa, coffee table, side table). Feel free to add, update, and remove any pre-existing APIs / controller methods in the backend service.

2. **Build Frontend UX**
   Create an elegant user interface to display selected furniture in a room. Demonstrate best practices in React component design, state management, and styling. Take a screenshot of the final, beautiful UX!

3. **System Design Questions**
   Answer the system design questions in `system-design/system-design-questions.md`.
